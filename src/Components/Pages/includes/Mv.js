                            Energify's purpose is to power progress together with more and cleaner energy solutions. We believe that rising standards of living for a growing global population are likely to continue to drive demand for energy, including oil and gas, for years to come. At the same time, the need to tackle climate change means there is a global transition under way to a low-carbon energy system.Our people are essential to the successful delivery of the Energify strategy and to sustaining business performance over the long term. Performing competitively in the evolving energy landscape requires competent and empowered people working safely together across Energify.
